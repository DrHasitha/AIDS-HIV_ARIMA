*Data source*

All raw data on the incidence and death of AIDS and HIV (in fact, many more infectious diseases) in China from 2004 to 2017 are publicly available from the [Data Center of China Public Health Science](http://www.phsciencedata.cn/Share/en/) database hosted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). 
<br/>

*ARIMA analysis*

After downloanding and preprocessing the AIDS/HIV datasets, we applied ARIMA analysis for six (2 x 3) models:
1. incidence and death (2 levels)
2. AIDS, HIV, and AIDS/HIV combined (3 levels)
